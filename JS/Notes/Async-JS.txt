JS is synchronous and single threaded language but there is possibility of async in Javascript
Async JS:
Let's take some kind of timers. There are timers avaialable in Browser.
 -- setTimeOut(fn,time in milli seconds): it runs the fn after specific time
 -- setInteval(fn, time in milli seconds): it runs the function after specific time and repeats for every interval of specific time
 -- ToClearOut timeout we use clearTimeOut(timeout obj)
 -- ToClearOut interval , we use clearInterval(interval obj)

 Promises:
  The Probelm with sychronous logic is it can be too nested like callback hell
  To avoid it we use Promises.Promise is an object which represents an official eventual completion of asynchronous operation. promises may or maynot get resolved

  --- Every asynchronous function returns promises
  --- promise is like function assuring that it will run in future
  --- promise may get resolved(.then ) or may get rejected(.catch)

API(Application Programming Interface)
API's are used to transfor the data through endpoint in JSON format

Is there a way to convert asynchronous into synchronous?
usually, asynchronous functions returns promises and these promises will get resolve later, but we make the program wait by using 'async-await'
