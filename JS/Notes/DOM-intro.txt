Document is an object which contains model of complete html and css. document object is stored inside the window object.
In JS, we can access HTML elements using document object

To learn Document Object Model, we need to learn 4 things
1. DOM selection
2. Events
3. DOM Manipulation
4. DOM Creation

1. DOM selection: we can select an HTML element in the DOM using 5 ways
  i.getElementById: select element by Id will give only one element since id is always unique
  ii.getElementsByClassName:selecting elements using class name results an array(HTML collection)
  iii.getElementsByTagName:selecting elements using tag name results an array(HTML collection)
  iv.querySelector: querySelector selects an element based on a css query but it selects only first element
  v.querySelectorAll:querySelector selects an element based on a css query and it selects all elements

2. DOM Manipulation: you can manipulate DOM elements Text,properties, style and even class also

 i.textContent: textContent is used to access the text inside the element
 ii. innerText: it is also used to access the text inside the element but it considers css
 if visibility : hidden it cannot see the elements
 iii. innerHTML : it reads the text as html code and executes it
 iv. value : it access values from HTML inputs
 v. classList.add()/remove()/toggle(): we can add class names/ remove class names/ toggle them
 vi.style: we can add any style use .style.proopertyname to the selector
