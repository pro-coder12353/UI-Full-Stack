Array is used to store multiple items/ colletion of several elements
Array stores the values based on index. always index starts from zero
let arr=[5,6,7,8], arrays will be embraed by square brackets
arr[0] =5, arr[1]=6,arr[7],arr[3]=8,arr[4]=undefined
arrays have some default methods to perform several operations
push() -- used to push elements into end of the arrays
pop() --- removes last element from the arrays
shift()--  removes the first element of th arrays
unshift() -- adds elements to the first if the arrays
splice(index-value,deleteCount,adding elements):  adds/ removes elements anywhere in array
indexOf()-- find indexOf given element
join()-- join all array elements into one string by some delimiter
reverse()-- reverse the whole arrray
sort()- sort the values lexigraphically
includes()-- true/false based on whether the given element is included in the array or not
concat()-- used to add two arrays
