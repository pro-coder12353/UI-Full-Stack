-> How do u apply CSS to HTML?

    There are 3 ways:
    i.Inline CSS: Mention CSS properties as "style" as a attribute in the line of element.

    ii.Internal CSS: We can mention CSS properties with "style" as a element in the head of HTML.
        <style>
            selector
            {
                //properties
            }
        </style>


        * Selector is the way styling can recognize the elements.
            Basic selectors are tag name,class name,id name
            [(.)=used to represent class]
            [(#)=used to represent ID]
            [ID>class>Tag name]
            [Inline CSS > Internal CSS]


    iii.External CSS:You can even mention all CSS as a External file called External CSS

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="path to css" />
