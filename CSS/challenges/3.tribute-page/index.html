        Mahesh Babu, a prominent figure in Telugu cinema, began his acting journey as a child star in 1979's "Needa," appearing in several films alongside his 
        father Krishna. After a hiatus to focus on education, he returned with his debut lead role in "Rajakumarudu" (1999), which earned him the Nandi Award for 
        Best Male Debut. His career saw significant highs with films like "Murari" (2001), "Okkadu" (2003), and "Athadu" (2005), but it was the 2006 blockbuster 
        "Pokiri" that catapulted him to superstardom, becoming the highest-grossing Telugu film of its time. Despite subsequent setbacks with films such as 
        "Sainikudu" (2006) and "Athidhi" (2007), Mahesh bounced back with milestones like "Dookudu" (2011), the first Telugu film to cross â‚¹1 billion in box 
        office collections. Known for his versatile roles, he received critical acclaim for "Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu" (2013), a rare multi-starrer 
        in Telugu cinema. His films "Srimanthudu" (2015), "Bharat Ane Nenu" (2018), and "Sarileru Neekevvaru" (2020) were commercial successes despite mixed reviews.
         Recently, "Sarkaru Vaari Paata" (2022) and "Guntur Kaaram" (2024) 
        continued his cinematic journey with varied critical reception, showcasing his enduring appeal and box office prowess in the Telugu film industry.
